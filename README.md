# EYEllow

**EYEllow** was a project for my undergraduated thesis submited to Federal University of Santa Catarina Electrical Department
in order to obtain an Electrical Engineer degree.

The final thesis document can be found [here (portuguese version)](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/202802).

The English version (less "*academic*", may I say) can be found here, in the **docs** folder (a working in progress).

The 3D Models was made using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).

# What is the EYEllow project

EYEllow is a software/hardware project to develop a device to acquire eye imaging from people and try to "quantify" the intensity of the yellow color in the eye sclera. 

The presence of the yellow color in the eye sclera (the white of the eye) can indicate bilirubin concentrations in bloodstream. 
The intensity of the yellow color in the eye sclera is proportional to the bilirubin levels. So this method could be a non-invasive way to know bilirubin levels in the bloodstream.

Some diseases can be diagnosed through bilirubin levels. The intent of this project is to provide an easier way to acquire eye imaging and get those yellow intensity levels, working as a tool for further research.
