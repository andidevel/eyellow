# EYEllow

EYEllow is a project for a undergraduated thesis submited to Federal University of Santa Catarina Electrical Department
in order to obtain an Electrical Engineer degree.

The final thesis document can be found [here (portuguese version)](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/202802).

The English version (less "*academic*", may I say) can be found here, in the **docs** folder.

The 3D Models was made using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).
